# Planning

:::{note}

This document is part of brain storming the project of cihai. It's for historic purposes only.

_Written Late 2013_

Scribblings on cihai dev.

## Configuration

It can accept a custom configuration file via command line with `-c`:

```console

$ python -m cihai -c myconfig.yml

```

Where your configuration file overrides the default settings. You can see the default settings in
the `cihai` package as `config.yml`.

Developers may use `dev/config.yml`. The TestCase will use the `test_config.yml`.

```console

$ python -m cihai

```

Will start up cihai with normal configuration settings. A configuration file may also be used.

```console

$ python -m cihai -c dev/config.yml

```

## History of CJK libraries

### Unihan

Unihan, which is short for "Han Unification" is a standard published by the Unicode Consortium for
CJK ideographs (also interchangeable referred to as "glyphs", "characters", "chars").

[Unihan's History][unihan's history] goes into greater detail on this. The first electronic release
was in July 1995 as [CJKXREF.TXT][cjkxref.txt] (961 kB). The second release, which resembles the
formatting used in modern versions, was released in July 1996 with Unicode 2.0 as
[Unihan-1.txt][unihan-1.txt]. In an accident, the `Unihan-1.txt` (7.9MB) file was missing the final
pieces after `U+8BC1`, no corrected version was made available. In May 1998,
[Unihan-2.txt][unihan-2.txt] was released with Unicode 2.1.2.

Unihan Inc. is the center of the universe for all glyphs. For those who study Egyptian
hieroglyphics, which are still mysterious, they are covered in Unicode block
[U+13000..U+1342F][u+13000..u+1342f].

### cjklib

[cjklib](cjklib) is a major python library created by Christoph Burgmer for han character research.

"Cjklib provides language routines related to Han characters (characters based on Chinese characters
named Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja and chu Han respectively) used in writing of the Chinese, the Japanese,
infrequently the Korean and formerly the Vietnamese language(s). Functionality is included for
character pronunciations, radicals, glyph components, stroke decomposition and variant information.
Cjklib is implemented in Python."

### Cihai

Early iterations of Cihai focused on external API as a first. Every data set was to be a plugin.

The idea was, [Hanzi][hanzi], a similar project in nodejs could share a similar API and datasets
could be universal. The potential would be to provide two high-quality libraries for python and
node, which are extendable to new data sets and reduce duplication.

It is better to take the time to discover the variable nature of datasets and how they interconnect.

### Current

The next iteration of cihai is to grasp an understand of:

- what different data sets look like, how they return data?
- is their commonality between all?
- how their results can illicit deeper research and exploring of chinese characters

This is an exploration phase.

## External API

### Cihai Spec

Both Cihai and Hanzi libraries can use a similar API.

- Reduce duplicated effort
- Provide a main, tested CJK library to Python and node
- Collaborate to assure both projects have access to open data sets and chinese character
  techniques.

Larger charter:

- Workgroup to develop a specification for core, pluggable CJK library across various programming
  languages.

  - follow best practices.

    - documentation
    - unit tests / ci
    - consistent with coding idiom's / pragmas (pythonic / pocoo / reits, connect / underscore /
      node)

  - be available on package archives (npm, pypi).
  - Across languages, core tools should have similar API method names, creating instance of data
    retrieval object
  - Extendable to new datasets as middleware.
  - Documentation for creating a new middleware.

- Find more data sets and encourage data providers / data owners to use an open data license.
- Find more libraries across various programming language with a CJK tool.

  - If project is a duplicate effort, notify that there is another effort underway and they can
    participate.
  - If project is a new tool:

    - see if they have a dataset. If it does, see license of ODC/OBDC.
    - see if their library is BSD or MIT. If not see if they're willing to license as such. \*
    - see if they are willing to use the Workgroup's API specification.
    - If willing, but no time, offer to patch.
    - If not interested at all, create an adapter for the project as a separate effort.

* if the library is GPL, it can cause conflict down the road, if the project author does not have
  the time / interest in adopting specification, even creating an adapter to their project could
  trigger GPL.

## Licensing

### Core software

BSD or MIT. The Core apps should be BSD 3-clause to protect the name of the app (Cihai or Hanzi).

### Extensions / Contrib licensing

Middleware can be included in the project as officially supported. Contrib and third party plugins
can be available under BSD or MIT.

### Data sets

Data for chinese should be available under the most permissive license possible.

## How should data be looked up?

I would like to try to encourage use of a single, simple hook, `.get`.

After `.get` is used, the arguments may then be passed through middleware classes / methods.

The same principle applies for `.reverse` matches.

### Chinese character

Currently, Hanzi uses:

```{code-block} javascript

hanzi.decompose('爱')

// transition to:
hanzi.get('爱')

hanzi.reverse('爱')  // to look up any indices / decompositions / words
where 爱 may match.

```

Currently cjklib uses:

```{code-block} python

cjk.getStrokeOrder(u'说')
#  transition to:
cjk.get('说')

```

```{code-block} python

Cihai.get('好')

```

### String of Chinese Characters

Use `.get` too. This may seem problematic, but checking the `.length` or `len()` of the argument can
suffice.

```{code-block} javascript

var decomposition = hanzi.decomposeMany('爱橄黃');
// transition to
var decomposition = hanzi.get('爱橄黃');

```

```{code-block} python

Cihai.get('爱橄黃')

```

## How should data returned look? Schema.

Questions:

- Is there already an open standard that can be adopted?
- Should `.get` return an raw object / dict or an object:

  ```
  c = c.get('你')  # return a ResultObject / Backbone.Model / mongoose
                   # document type of object.
  c.toJSON()  # backbone / sqlalchemy style
  ```

The data should follow the same schema. What would an API response for these possibilities look
like?

If something generic like .get() is entered,

- character decomposition
- a unihan field ('kDefinition', 'kStrokes', 'kFrequency', ...)
- <https://github.com/tsroten/zhon>
- <https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba>

If `.get` is the only way to retrieve hits, more possibilities exist.

For hanzi/node:

```{code-block} javascript

results = hanzi.get('你好。怎么样？')

```

or for cihai/python:

```{code-block} python

results = cihai.get('你好。怎么样？')

```

May return hits jieba middleware (jieba doesn't exist in node yet):

```
results.words = [
'你好',
'怎么样'
]
```

The user may then further tool:

```{code-block} python

for word in results.words:
    print(cihai.get(word))

```

or

```{code-block} javascript

for _.each(results.words, function(word) {
    console.log(hanzi.get(word))
});

```

:::{warning}

If dictionaries / datasets are extensible, there may be collision if they can reserve keys in the
official result namespace.

:::

Two plugins may could try to reserve `.words` as a name. Many dictionaries would want to reserve
`.definition` as a name.

To counteract this, a namespace can be adopted for middleware, we can have the Core resolve the
conflict:

1. Append underscore + number on conflict, etc. (`c.definition_1`, `c.definition_2`):

   The first middleware using `words` can get `result.words`. The middleware called after will get
   `results.words_1`.

   This is seen in [SQLAlchemy's labels][sqlalchemy's labels] to [avoid label
   collisions][avoid label collisions].

2. Middleware / datasets use namespace with `_` (`c.unihan_kDefinition`):

   Pros:

   - iterable access to python `c.keys()` and `for var key in dict` in js.
   - all data returned can be accessed without nesting into dotted namespaces.

   Cons:

   - `result.unihan_kDefinition_these_things_getlong`
   - extension name and word separation can be confused.

3. Middleware may use dot namespace (`c.unihan.kDefinition`)

   Pros:

   - Internal Core API is far simpler and lighter
   - Easier to look at
   - More common practice, [aws_cli][aws_cli].
   - Middleware is a package module, symbolically `.`'s are used to separate modules and packages
     (java, python, informally in JS).

## Extension philosophy

The middleware approach provides the best practice to get the job done.

[Connect][connect] in node represents the best practice in plugin architecture in JS. Middleware is
added as a way to provide a lite, dead-simple framework.

Cihai / Hanzi can take a similar approach.

Hanzi can take example directly from connect's approach. It is clean and proven. Cihai can note
middleware is already used in Django, packages can be maintained using pattern for Flask extensions
and sphinx. Flask already has experience / lesson's heard from packaging and namespacing extensions.

It can use the same data sets, similar API and extension strategy.

[connect]: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect

## Accessing extensions directly?

Perhaps extensions can also be searched directly:

```
c.unihan.get('好')
```

Third party API's can specify optional extra arguments, for instance, unihan may allow searching by
one field:

```
c.unihan.get('好', 'kDefinition')
```

This allows a simple way to "drill down" cjk data across extensions.

## API examples

Example:

```{code-block} python

obj = unihan.get('好') retrieves all rows. it will create a keyed object:
obj.kDefinition
obj['kDefinition']
obj.keys()
['kDefinition',]

obj = unihan.get('好', 'kDefinition', ...)
>>> obj.kDefinition
good
>>> obj.kStrokes
None

```

## Creating a cihai plugin

```{code-block} python

class Unihan(Cihai.Contrib):

    """
    Utilizing a parent class can allow raising ``NotImplementedError``
    errors. Further, this can provide access to a ``db``.

    However, ultimately, the only thing that's really required is::

        class Example(object):

            def get(self, char):
                return {
                    'char': char
                }

    """

    def get(self):
        pass

    def install(self):
        pass

cihai = Cihai()
cihai.use(Unihan)  # register the middleware with
c = cihai.get('好')
>>> c.keys()
['unihan']
>>> c.get('好')
<Cihai.Contrib.Unihan>
>>> print(c.get('好'))
>>> print(c.get('好').parent)

# Below this point, libunihan splits into subplugins for its libraries.
>>> print(dict(c.get('好')))

```

Cihai will allows extensibility to new dictionaries, vocabularies and data.

Middleware allows an arbitrary plugin to make data available.

By default, `Cihai()` creates an instance of Cihai with access to {meth}`Cihai.get`.

However, since no middleware are included with Cihai, no results are returned.

With `Cihai(middleware=[Cihai.Unihan])`

or `c = Cihai()`

`c.use(Cihai.Unihan)`

the Cihai_Unihan is available. What is Cihai_Unihan? Simply an object with:

```{code-block} python

class Unihan(Cihai.Contrib):

    pass

```

# Extending

:::{note}

This document is part of brain storming the project of cihai. It's for historic purposes only.

_Written Late 2013_

## Minimum usage

1. Create a python module
2. The module has a class with a `get.()` to look up characters by signature
   `(request, response, *args, **kwargs)`.

With `.get()`, your class may be instantiated and passed into `Cihai`. When a user runs `.get()`
inside of `Cihai`, it will check your module's `.get()` also:

```
+----------+
| Cihai    |  The Cihai Class
+----------+
```

It is instantiated with a database to connect to ({class}`sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData`):

```{code-block} python

c = Cihai(metadata=metadata)

```

`MetaData` is part of the sqlalchemy library. It holds connection and table information. In this
instance, cihai shares this information across all plugins that attach to it.

To attach a plugin:

```{code-block} python

from MyCihaiModule import MyDataset
mydata = MyDataSet()
c.use(mydata)

```

`c`, the instance of {class}`Cihai`, may now access `MyDataSet`'s information.

### Code

```{code-block} python

c = Cihai()

c.use(DatasetExample)
print(c.reverse('hao'))
>>> {
    'definition': 'hao'
}

print(c.get('ä½ '))
>>> {
    'definition': 'hao'
}

```

## Growing big

The above was an example of the minimum requirement to have your dataset compatible.

### Importing data into database

One of the goals of Cihai is to provide a common way to access to Chinese data. To import the data,
you must create an SQL schema / table for your data.

The pristine format of your data may be in CSV, excel or another format. As long as your data is
normalized into a {obj}`dict` that is compatible with the sql table, it is ok.

To accommodate this, {class}`Cihai` provides all plugins a instance of
{class}`sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData` on creation. [sqlalchemy][sqlalchemy] is the swiss army knife of
databases in the python programming language.

With an instance of `MetaData`, you will be able to create SQL tables, import and retrieve data.

### Deeper

In previous examples, the plugin class with `.get` and `.reverse` character lookups was merged with
1 SQL table.

As said previously, it doesn't matter how or where the data comes from. As long as {class}`Cihai`
can retrieve data via `.get` with the correct arguments and response. The prior example had the data
class combined with a single table.

In databases that use multiple tables, you may create a central dataset class with `.get()` and
access the tables from there.

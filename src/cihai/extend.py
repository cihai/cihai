Cihai Plugin System

Status: Experimental, API can change

As a pilot, the UNIHAN library, and an plugin for it, in #131 [1]_

You can bring any data layout / backend you like to cihai.

For convenience, you can use cihai's configuration namespace and SQLAlchemy settings.

You can also create plugins which extend another. So if Unihan doesn't have a lookup
for variant glyphs, this can be added.

    This piggybacks cihai's global config state, as well as your datasets.

    Cihai will automatically manage the user's config, as well as your datasets,
    neatly in XDG.

    Raises
    ------
    Functions inside, and what you write relating to dataset config should return

    CihaiDatasetConfigException (CihaiDatasetException)

    config.cihai = links directly back to Cihai's configuration dictionary

    check() : function, optional
        this is ran on start. it can raise DatasetConfigException

    default_config : your dataset's default configuration

    get_default_config : override function in case you'd like custom configs (for
        instance if you want a platform to use a different db driver, or do version
        checks, etc.)

    In addition, this mixin gives you access to any other of the user's sqlalchemy
    sql that use this mixin. So if you want a dataset that utilizes UNIHAN, you can
    access that easily.
